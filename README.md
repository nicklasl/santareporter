# Santa Reporter

Santa reporter is a way for me to get a feel for Jetpack Compose. It should not really be considered a reference on how to use Compose. It's probably not really best practice.

It's also a way to scare my kids who believe in Santa Claus that I'm sending updates to Santa about their behavior before Christmas.
